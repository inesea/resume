# Resume

This is a sequel to my original [hhh-resume-tool](https://github.com/inesea/hhh-resume-tool) project. 

The new resume is a more lightweight project. It is build in React, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses [window.print()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/print)` Web API to trigger the export to PDF functionality.

## Run the app with

```
npm install
npm start
```
